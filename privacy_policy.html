Collection of your Personal Information

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Sloper Inc.. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Sloper Inc. for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Sloper Inc. site.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Sloper Inc. public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Sloper Inc. does not read any of your private online communications.

Sloper Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Sloper Inc. so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Sloper Inc. is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Sloper Inc. and Sloper Inc. family of Web sites.

Use of your Personal Information

Sloper Inc. collects and uses your personal information to operate the Sloper Inc. Web site and deliver the services you have requested. Sloper Inc. also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Sloper Inc. and its affiliates. Sloper Inc. may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Sloper Inc. does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Sloper Inc. may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Sloper Inc. may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

Sloper Inc. keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within Sloper Inc., in order to determine what Sloper Inc. services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Sloper Inc. to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Use of Cookies

The Sloper Inc. Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Sloper Inc. pages, or register with Sloper Inc. site or services, a cookie helps Sloper Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Sloper Inc. Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Sloper Inc. features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sloper Inc. services or Web sites you visit.

Security of your Personal Information

Sloper Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Sloper Inc. secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Changes to this Statement

Sloper Inc. will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Sloper Inc. encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Sloper Inc. is protecting your information.
